I hope you know the beautiful Union-Find structure. In this problem, you’re to implement something similar, but not identical. 
The data structure you need to write is also a collection of disjoint sets, supporting 3 operations:

1 p q
Union the sets containing p and q. If p and q are already in the same set, ignore this command.
2 p q
Move p to the set containing q. If p and q are already in the same set, ignore this command
3 p
Return the number of elements and the sum of elements in the set containing p.
Initially, the collection contains n sets: {1},{2},{3},…,{n}.

As an example, consider the sequence of operations in sample input 1 below.

Initially: {1},{2},{3},{4},{5}
Collection after operation 1 1 2: {1,2},{3},{4},{5}
Collection after operation 2 3 4: {1,2},{3,4},{5} (we omit the empty set that is produced when taking out 3 from {3})
Collection after operation 1 3 5: {1,2},{3,4,5}
Collection after operation 2 4 1: {1,2,4},{3,5}

Input
There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers n and m (1≤n,m≤100000), 
the number of integers, and the number of commands. Each of the next m lines contains a command. 
For every operation, 1≤p,q≤n. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF). The size of input file does not exceed 5MB.

Output
For each type-3 command, output 2 integers: the number of elements and the sum of elements.
